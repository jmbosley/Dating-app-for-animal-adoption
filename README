HTML base:
You can write code you want to appear on every page into base.html.

Migration:
Whenever you change the database schema (add/change a model in models.py), you can update the database with:
$ flask db migrate : update new database schema
$ flask db upgrade : upgrade to that schema you just created
$ flask db downgrade : downgrade to previous version. you can delete the newest version file in migrations/versions
to abandon the version you just downgraded from
More info about migration and databases: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database

You can also delete the .db file and migrations folder to completely start over. After you've done this, run:
$ flask db init
and then the migrate, upgrade commands again.

SQLite notes:
SQLite is an SQL database contained in a file: flaskapp.db
There are lots of online tools for viewing it.
I'm currently using DBeaver to view the database while debugging. Not sure if that's the best option.

SQL alchemy tutorial:
If you'd like to use it, this website is very helpful:
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/constraints.html
SQL Datatype Objects:
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/types.html
It's just the standard mySQL stuff translated to Python.

I created a brief demonstration of how the SQL code works in the /sqldemo route of main.py.
